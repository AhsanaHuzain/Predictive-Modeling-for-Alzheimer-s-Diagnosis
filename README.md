‘Predicting Alzheimer’s  Disease Using Machine Learning: A Data-Driven Approach to Early Detection and  Risk Factor Analysis.’
Alzheimer’s is a brain disorder that affects memory and thinking. Early detection is important for better care. This project uses a dataset with 74,283 records to explore risk factors and build a machine learning model that helps predict the disease.

# Objectives
Identify key risk factors for Alzheimer’s

Build and evaluate machine learning models

Analyze the importance of different features

Provide insights for early prevention and intervention


# The dataset includes:

Demographics: Age, Gender, Country, Education, Income, Marital Status

Lifestyle: Physical Activity, Smoking, Alcohol, Diet, Social Life

Medical History: BMI, Diabetes, Hypertension, Depression, Sleep, Stress

Genetics: APOE-ε4 allele

Assessments: Cognitive Test Score, Alzheimer’s Diagnosis (Target)


# Results:

Best model: Gradient Boosting Classifier with 76.59% accuracy

Top features: Age, APOE-ε4 gene, Cognitive score, Family history, Social engagement

# Insights
Both biological and lifestyle factors influence Alzheimer’s risk

Machine learning can support early diagnosis and care strategies

# Future Plans
Use time-series data for better predictions

Try deep learning with brain scans or clinical notes

Make a prediction app for doctors and patients

Improve model accuracy with expert input

# Tools Used
Python

Pandas

Seaborn & Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

SMOTE for class balancing

GridSearchCV for tuning
